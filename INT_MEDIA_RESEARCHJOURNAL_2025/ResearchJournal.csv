Lauren is a Professor at UCLA Design Media Arts. She holds an MFA from UCLA and a BS Computer Science and BS Art and Design from MIT.

""I am working with performance, software, electronics, internet, film, photography, installation. My work exists within and beyond the gallery, seeking edges of art and media performance. There are different layers of experience, from the intimate performance to a much wider audience invited in through the ripples of viral videos and media coverage.Each work feels like an attempt to hack my way out of myself and into closeness with others. I am embodying machines, trying to understand that distance between the algorithm and myself, the distance between others and me. Vera Molnár was a Hungarian media artist who lived and worked in France. Molnár is widely considered to have been a pioneer of computer art and generative art and was also one of the first women to use computers in her art practice.""",https://freight.cargo.site/w/1500/q/75/i/65963998f6eef928cf091ece4efdf01553217479791230b8c1c1f14f1dc3372a/Selphish-Lauren-McCarthy-Autocomplete_4731_2.jpg,https://freight.cargo.site/w/1500/q/75/i/0721e847e235ede4c18e203cb305ef22ac94f6a4fc76f09ae5349b368a36d450/seeing-voices8.jpg,"Autoreply, 2020",Seeing Voices is a series of AI images generated by the performance Voice In My Head.,https://lauren-mccarthy.com/,"CreativeCoding, Javascript, Artist, P5js",
